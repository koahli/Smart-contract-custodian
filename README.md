# Smart-contract-custodian
A second smart contract after the token offering

The replication of classic governance signals through smart contracts shows the disruptive potential and could lead to a broader adaption.  An example is the fund release only at certain events.

An idea to implement such a governance signal would be a custodian smart contract. A certain percentage of the funded capital would be sent to a second smart contract. It could be released to the firm’s wallet with a pre-defined function, at certain events or milestones. As those events need to be actual pre-defined and are like every smart contract immutable, a voting right of the issued tokens would make sense.
Voting on certain topics is implemented by 18%,  while about 12% of the projects are fully decentralised with voting rights.  Thereby are voting rights a positive impact on the offering’s success.  The rights could also depend on the firm’s state, providing the investors more rights in a bad situation.  In combination with locked up cryptocurrency, the smart contract could contain a liquidation option, paying every token holder a fraction of his money back in exchange for the token when enough holders voted for it. Thereby should the voting and the transfer to a votable token rely on the best practices on Openzeppe-lin.

As lock ups could be hardcoded,  but decrease the liquidity it would make sense to provide liquidity on the crypto exchange Uniswap. At Uniswap everybody can function as a market maker with just offering a pair of tokens that can be exchanged by others. In this way locked tokens could provide liquidity.
Smart contracts like this could signal commitment and make exit scams less lucrative, because the opportunity costs of bad quality offerings are higher than the costs of good quality ones. 

The text is from my bachelor thesis about signalling in token offerings (I will add the citations later). The described smart contracts could be strong governance signals which I will investigate with a survey. The link will be provided here. If the results indicate a demand for this kind of smart contract it will be implemented here.
